# Training to learn... web development 

It's time to learn how to learn, not just for a tick, but for yourself - qualitatively, truly, forever. However, this process is not easy, no matter what you want to learn: cooking, photo and video processing or programming. This project has merged some tips and short facts about education time. It has the best techniques, examples, and useful resources.

## Functions

On this site the user is able to:
* watch videos about working with procrastination and time to learn something new from Youtube;
* find a book about innovation in learning;
* take enough resources about training.

## Technology stack

The file structure is organized according to the [BEM methodolgy](https://ru.bem.info/methodology/ "Read more about BEM here"), which means flexibility in modifying the project. Each block can be reused if additional information is needed, or removing without the participation of neighboring blocks.

For the users' convenience:
1. links are responsive when hovering with the `:hover` pseudo-class.
2. navigation through menu and social networks.
3. videos watching within a project page using `<iframe>`.
